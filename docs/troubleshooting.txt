Pinokio Troubleshooting

Some common issues when running the Gradio apps on Pinokio and their solutions:

1. FluidSynth / SoundFont errors

fluidsynth: error: fluid_is_soundfont(): fopen() failed: 'File does not exist.'

Solution: Make sure a SoundFont is installed at ~/.fluidsynth/default_sound_font.sf2. You can download a free General MIDI SoundFont, e.g.:

mkdir -p ~/.fluidsynth
wget https://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.sf2 -O ~/.fluidsynth/default_sound_font.sf2


2. pygame audio playback errors

pygame.error: Couldn't open timidity.cfg

Solution: Ensure that timidity is installed on Pinokio:

sudo apt install timidity


3. Missing Python packages / ImportErrors

Always activate the virtual environment before running the apps:

source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. MIDI → WAV rendering issues

Ensure both FluidSynth and pydub dependencies are correctly installed. Some apps require ffmpeg:

sudo apt install ffmpeg


5. LLM not loaded or prompt parsing fails

Currently, a DummyLLM is used for testing.

Real LLMs (Mistral, GPT-based) can be configured via Ollama or other interfaces.

Prompts must follow the syntax expected by the LLM, e.g., Make measure 1 more romantic.
