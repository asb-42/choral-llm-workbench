An offline-capable, open-source tool for composing, harmonizing,
and arranging choral music (starting with SATB) using symbolic
notation (MusicXML) and LLM-assisted editing.

## Goals
- MusicXML as single source of truth
- Modular architecture
- Offline usage via Ollama
- Simple UI (Gradio) for early prototyping
- CLI tools for testing and automation

## Status
Early development / prototype
